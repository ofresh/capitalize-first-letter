Sure, here's a simple README file for your open-source project:

```
# capitalize-first-letter-js

## Description
capitalize-first-letter-js is a lightweight JavaScript function designed to capitalize the first letter of each word in a given string.

## Installation
You can simply copy the `capitalizeFirstLetter` function into your JavaScript project.

## Usage
```javascript
// Import or define the capitalizeFirstLetter function

// Example usage:
let inputString = "hello world how are you";
let result = capitalizeFirstLetter(inputString);
console.log(result); // Output: "Hello World How Are You"
```

## How it works
The `capitalizeFirstLetter` function takes a string as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string. It achieves this by using a regular expression to match the first character of each word and replacing it with its uppercase version.
